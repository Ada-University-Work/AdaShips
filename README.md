# Known Issues
* spaces and non-standard capitalisation of the config file causes an error that breaks the programme. It is recommended you follow the current format when adding to the config file to prevent these errors.
* placing a ship hasn't been configured to work with board sizes bigger than 10
* in order for the code to technically support any number of boats I haven't added functionality to check whether the boats provided will fit in the specified board.
